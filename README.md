# QuickFork Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the QuickFork!

You can find here details about the QuickFork, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by type of activities: 

* [Business modeling](#Business-Modelling) 
  * [Product Vision](#Product-Vision)
  * [Features and Assumptions](#Features-and-Assumptions)
  * [Elevator Pitch](#Elevator-pitch)
* [Requirements](#Requirements)
  * [User stories](#User-stories)
  * [Domain model](#Domain-model)
* [Architecture and Design](#Architecture-And-Design)
  * [Logical architecture](#Logical-Architecture)
  * [Physical architecture](#Physical-Architecture)
  * [Vertical prototype](#Vertical-Prototype)

Contributions are expected to be made exclusively by the initial team, but we may open them to the community, after the course, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

Thank you!

## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

Start by defining a clear and concise vision for your app, to help members of the team, contributors, and users into focusing their often disparate views into a concise, visual, and short textual form. It provides a "high concept" of the product for marketers, developers, and managers.

A product vision describes the essential of the product and sets the direction to where a product is headed, and what the product will deliver in the future. 

**We favor a catchy and concise statement, ideally one sentence.**

### Features and Assumptions
 - Buy canteen tickets - Purchase canteen tickets effortlessly without needing physical copies and wainting in the line. 
 - Consult canteen menus - Easily view menus for specific days to decide on purchasing tickets.
 - Payment with card and MB Way - Pay for tickets using either card or MB Way, ensuring a smooth transaction process.
 - Save payment methods - Store your preferred payment methods for future purchases, to improve the buying process.
 - Consult bought meals - Check previously purchased meals to stay organized and keep track of your history.
 - Validation of tickets - Enable workers to validate tickets within the app, ensuring a safe and efficient process.
 - Login with SIGARRA credentials - Log in using SIGARRA credentials, simplifying access and providing a faster login experience for users.

### Elevator Pitch
Draft a small text to help you quickly introduce and describe your product in a short time (lift travel time ~90 seconds) and a few words (~800 characters), a technique usually known as elevator pitch.

Take a look at the following links to learn some techniques:

## Requirements

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module. 
Also provide a short textual description of each concept (domain class). 

Example:
<p align="center" justify="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/2LEIC18T2/tree/main/images/DomainModel.png?raw=true"/>
</p>




## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization. 

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them. 

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code (Logical View), using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

It can be beneficial to present the system in a horizontal decomposition, defining layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts.

Example of _UML package diagram_ showing a _logical view_ of the Eletronic Ticketing System (to be accompanied by a short description of each package):

![LogicalView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9655877/160585416-b1278ad7-18d7-463c-b8c6-afa4f7ac7639.png)

### Physical architecture
The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams (Deployment View) or component diagrams (Implementation View), separate or integrated, showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for ESOF are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (such as Flutter).

Example of _UML deployment diagram_ showing a _deployment view_ of the Eletronic Ticketing System (please notice that, instead of software components, one should represent their physical/executable manifestations for deployment, called artifacts in UML; the diagram should be accompanied by a short description of each node and artifact):

![DeploymentView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9655877/160592491-20e85af9-0758-4e1e-a704-0db1be3ee65d.png)

### Vertical prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system integrating as much technologies we can.

In this subsection please describe which feature, or part of it, you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a small part of a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).


## Project management
Software project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we recommend each team to adopt a set of project management practices and tools capable of registering tasks, assigning tasks to team members, adding estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Common practices of managing iterative software development are: backlog management, release management, estimation, iteration planning, iteration development, acceptance tests, and retrospectives.

You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Sprint backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/projects/64);
* Release management: [v0](#), v1, v2, v3, ...;
* Sprint planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: screenshots of Github Projects board at begin and end of each iteration;
  * retrospectives: meeting notes in a document in the repository;
