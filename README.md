## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

Skip the line, save time. A revolutionary app designed to transform the canteen experience at FEUP by simplifying the queuing process. Our vision to create an organized and efficient platform that’s not only user-friendly but also allows students to maximize their time.

### Features and Assumptions
 - Buy canteen tickets - Purchase canteen tickets effortlessly without needing physical copies and wainting in the line. 
 - Consult canteen menus - Easily view menus for specific days to decide on purchasing tickets.
 - Payment with card and MB Way - Pay for tickets using either card or MB Way, ensuring a smooth transaction process.
 - Save payment methods - Store your preferred payment methods for future purchases, to improve the buying process.
 - Consult bought meals - Check previously purchased meals to stay organized and keep track of your history.
 - Validation of tickets - Enable workers to validate tickets within the app, ensuring a safe and efficient process.
 - Login with SIGARRA credentials - Log in using SIGARRA credentials, simplifying access and providing a faster login experience for users.

### Elevator Pitch
Draft a small text to help you quickly introduce and describe your product in a short time (lift travel time ~90 seconds) and a few words (~800 characters), a technique usually known as elevator pitch.

Take a look at the following links to learn some techniques:
